#Mini project for TIWSNE
#Project 7 - Image Compression using TelosB mote

Load a black and white image file from PC to a TelosB mote.
The image is of size 256X256, each pixel of 8 bits.

Basic requirement:
 - Make a simple compression operation of the image
 - Transmit the compressed image to the sink
 - The sink reconstructs the image
 - Analyze the energy consumption with w/o compression.
Advanced study:
 - Apply different compression operations of the image
 - Compare different compression algorithm in terms of computational cost and recovered image quality
